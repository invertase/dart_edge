# Supabase Config

The following Supabase configuration options are supported via the `edge.yaml` file. All options are optional.

```yaml
supabase:
  # The path to root of where your Supabase project exists.
  projectPath: '.'
  # An object of functions and their entrypoints to build.
  # This is used if you have multiple Supabase function entrypoints.
  functions:
    dart_edge: 'lib/main.dart'
  # The compiler optimization level to use for development builds.
  devCompilerLevel: 01
  # The compiler optimization level to use for production builds.
  prodCompilerLevel: 04
  # Whether to exit the development watch process when a build fails.
  exitWatchOnFailure: false
```

## Multiple entrypoints

It's common in a Supabase project to have multiple entrypoints for your Supabase functions, since Supabase deploys
multiple Edge Functions per entrypoint. 

By default, a `dart_edge` function will be created, which points to your `lib/main.dart` file. Use the `functions` option
to specify additional entrypoints, for example

```yaml
supabase:
  functions:
    api_handler: 'lib/api.dart'
    webhook_handler: 'lib/webhooks.dart'
```
