# Dart Edge

Dart Edge is a project aimed at running Dart code on Edge functions, including support for platforms such as [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) & [Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions) (more to come).

<Warning>
  Dart Edge is an experimental project - it's probably not ready for production
  usage unless you're okay with living on the 'edge'.
</Warning>

## How it works

Dart Edge provides a runtime package which enables Dart to communicate with APIs found on Edge runtime environments. Your Dart code is compiled to JavaScript (and soon WASM), and deployed to a runtime environment, or platform such as Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge Functions.

The package also provides additional platform specific bindings where possible, such as [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects/). Not everything is supported yet, we'll get there eventually.

## Getting started

For local development and using the platform CLIs, you'll need to ensure [NodeJS (18.14.0+)](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your machine.

The easiest way to get started is to install the `edge` CLI:

```sh
dart pub global activate edge
```

Next create a new project for your specific provider:

<Tabs
  values={[
    { label: 'Vercel Edge', value: 'vercel' },
    { label: 'Cloudflare Workers', value: 'cloudflare' },
    { label: 'Supabase Edge Functions', value: 'supabase' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="vercel">
    ```sh
    edge new vercel_edge new_project
    ```

    View the [Vercel Edge](/platform/vercel) docs for more information on APIs, usage and deployment.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cloudflare">
    ```sh
    edge new cloudflare_workers new_project
    ```

    View the [Cloudflare Workers](/platform/cloudflare) docs for more information on APIs, usage and deployment.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="supabase">
    ```sh
    edge new supabase_functions new_project
    ```

    View the [Supabase Edge Functions](/platform/supabase) docs for more information on APIs, usage and deployment.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What next?

Each platform is slightly different, so visit the platform specific documentation on how to work with platform specific APIs, handle local development and deployment.
