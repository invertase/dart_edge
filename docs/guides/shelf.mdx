description: Use Shelf to handle requests and responses with Dart Edge.

# Shelf

The [Shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf) package is a popular Dart package which acts as a middleware
for incoming HTTP requests. There is a rich ecosystem of packages around Shelf, including [routers](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_router) and
middleware.

Dart Edge provides a lightweight wrapper for interfacing with a [Shelf Request](https://pub.dev/documentation/shelf/latest/shelf/Request-class.html) and handling a returned Shelf [Response](https://pub.dev/documentation/shelf/latest/shelf/Response-class.html), enalbing you take take advantage of this ecosystem of [Shelf packages](https://pub.dev/packages?q=shelf).

## Usage

### Vercel Edge

Install the `shelf` and `shelf_router` packages from pub.dev:

```sh
dart pub add shelf
dart pub add shelf_router
```

Import the `VercelEdgeShelf` class from the `vercel_edge/vercel_edge_shelf.dart` package, and route the request to a Shelf `Router`:

```dart
import 'package:vercel_edge/vercel_edge_shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf_router/shelf_router.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';

void main() {
  VercelEdgeShelf(
    fetch: (request) async {
      final app = Router();

      app.get('/', (request, String id) async {
        return Response.ok('Welcome to Dart Edge!');
      });

      app.all('/<ignored|.*>', (request) {
        return Response.notFound('Resource not found');
      });

      return app(request);
    },
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you could return a [`Pipeline`](https://pub.dev/documentation/shelf/latest/shelf/Pipeline-class.html) handler to apply middleware to your requests.
